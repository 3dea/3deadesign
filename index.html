  <h3>My Story</h3>
  <p>I completed my Industrial Design Degree at the University of Johannesburg
    in 2010. Afterwhich, I was offered a position at Barrows Design and Manufacturing
    having done a 3 week internship with them. I was responsible for ideation of
    concepts, running brainstorm sessions, sketching out initial concepts and translating
    those into photorealistic renders.

    In 2016 I emmigrated to the UK where I continued to work for Barrows London on
    a freelance capacity. The work environment differed in that I was now in a smaller,
    more personal team and the projects reflected that. The translation from design to
    manufacture had become more of my responsibility.

    In 2019 I took a position at Frontline Display International where I initially
    joined a team in the Development Design Department of which I later headed up
    myself with a small team. I am responsible for creating the engineering drawings
    for which the design concept can be manufactured. Having a design background,
    that translation is a lot smoother.</p>
